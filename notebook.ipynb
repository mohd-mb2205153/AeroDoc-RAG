This interval is \\nusually governed by the number of hours the powerplant \\nhas been in operation. The actual overhaul period for a \\nspecific engine is generally determined by the manufacturer’s \\nrecommendations. Each engine manufacturer sets a total \\ntime in service when the engine should be removed from \\nservice and overhauled. Depending upon how the engine \\nis used in service, the overhaul time can be mandatory. The \\noverhaul time is listed in hours and is referred to as time \\nbefore overhaul (TBO). For example, if an engine had a life \\nof 2,000 hours and had operated 500 hours, it would have a \\nTBO of 1,500 hours. Tests and experience have shown that \\noperation beyond this period of time could result in certain \\nparts being worn beyond their safe limits. For an overhauled \\nengine to be as airworthy as a new one, worn parts, as well \\nas damaged parts, must be detected and replaced during \\noverhaul. The only way to detect all unairworthy parts is to \\nperform a thorough and complete overhaul process while the \\nengine is disassembled. The major purpose of overhaul is to \\ninspect, repair, and replace worn engine parts.\\nA complete overhaul process includes the following ten \\nsteps: receiving inspection; disassembly; visual inspection; \\ncleaning; structural inspection; non-destructive testing (NDT) \\ninspection; dimensional inspection; repair and replacement; \\nreassembly; and testing and break in. The inspection phases \\nare the most precise and the most important phases of the \\noverhaul. Inspection cannot be slighted or performed in a \\ncareless or incomplete manner. It is always recommended \\nthat complete records be made of the inspection process and \\nkept with the engine records.\\nEach engine manufacturer provides very specific tolerances \\nto which the engine parts must conform and provides general \\ninstructions to aid in determining the airworthiness of the \\npart. However, in many cases, the final determination must \\nbe made by the technician. Although the determination must \\nbe made if the part is serviceable, repairable, or should be \\nrejected, the technician should follow the manufacturer’s \\nmanuals and information. When dimensional tolerances \\nare concerned, the manufacturer publishes a new minimum \\nand serviceable dimension for all critical component parts. \\nKnowledge of the operating principles, strength, and stresses \\nEngine Maintenance & Operation\\nChapter 10\\napplied to a part is essential in making decisions regarding \\nvisible wear. When the powerplant technician signs the release \\nfor the return to service for an overhauled engine, this certifies \\nthat the complete overhaul process has been performed using \\nmethods, techniques, and practices acceptable to the Federal \\nAviation Administration (FAA) Administrator.\\nTop Overhaul\\nReciprocating piston aircraft engines can be repaired by a \\ntop overhaul. This means an overhaul of those parts on top of \\nthe crankcase, without completely dismantling the engine. It \\nincludes removal of the units (i.e., exhaust collectors, ignition \\nharness, intake pipes) necessary to remove the cylinders. The \\nactual top overhaul consists of reconditioning the engine’s \\ncylinders by replacing or reconditioning the piston and \\npiston rings, and reconditioning or plating the cylinder wall \\nand valve-operating mechanism, including valve guides if \\nneeded. A top overhaul is a little misleading, because it is \\nreally an engine repair procedure and not a real overhaul \\nas described earlier. Usually at this time, the accessories \\nrequire no attention other than that normally required during \\nordinary maintenance functions. This repair is generally due \\nto valves or piston rings wearing prematurely. Many stress \\nthat if an engine requires this much dismantling, it should \\nbe completely disassembled and receive a major overhaul.\\nMajor Overhaul & Major Repairs\\nMajor overhaul consists of the complete reconditioning of \\nthe powerplant. A reciprocating engine would require that the \\ncrankcase be disassembled per the FAA; a major overhaul \\nis not generally a major repair. A certified powerplant-rated \\ntechnician can perform or supervise a major overhaul of an \\nengine if it is not equipped with an internal supercharger \\nor has a propeller reduction system other than spur-type \\ngears. At regular intervals, an engine should be completely \\ndismantled, thoroughly cleaned, and inspected. Each part \\nshould be overhauled in accordance with the manufacturer’s \\ninstructions and tolerances for the engine involved. At this \\ntime all accessories are removed, overhauled, and tested. \\nAgain, instructions from the manufacturer of the accessory \\nconcerned should be followed.\\nGeneral Overhaul Procedures\\nBecause of the continued changes and the many different \\ntypes of engines in use, it is not possible to treat the specific')"
